MIPS32-R1 Standalone
--------------------

The files in this directory create a complete MIPS32 processor. The top-level
module is "Processor.v". The interface includes 5 general-purpose hardware
interrupts, a non-maskable hardware interrupt, the 8 pending ISA interrupts
(for diagnostics--this can be removed), and a memory interface for both
instructions and data.

The memory interface is implemented as a four-way handshake:

    1. Read/Write request goes high.
    2. Ack goes high when data is available.
    3. Read/Write request goes low.
    4. Ack signal goes low.
            ____
    R/W: __|    |____
               ____
    Ack: _____|    |____

This interface is simple and robust but will limit the performance of the
system. In the SoC design this is currently the case, since the instruction
memory fetches only once per handshake. This greatly increases the minimum
theoretical CPI from 1 to between 3 and 4.

IMPORTANT!
If you want to achieve maximum performance (IPC close to 1.0), you must
modify the memory handshake! (One future goal of this project is to provide
a simple i-cache and single-cycle instruction accesses to the front-end.)
